{"prompt": "### Prompt:\nWrite a short movie review.\n### Constraint:\n80–140 words, positive tone, no spoilers.", "completion": "Review: Anchored by understated performances, the film turns a familiar reunion setup into something tender. The camera favors close, observant frames, and the score leaves room for silence. A late reveal works because the script seeds it early. It’s the kind of story that lingers not for twists but for how these characters breathe on screen."}
{"prompt": "### Prompt:\nWrite a short movie review.\n### Constraint:\n80–140 words, negative tone, no insults or spoilers.", "completion": "Review: Despite a strong premise, the film never settles on a rhythm. Scenes drift, and the needle drops underline emotions the actors already manage. Dialogue leans on clichés, and the third act resolves conflicts it barely sets up. It’s not unwatchable, just frustrating—the raw materials are here, but the script refuses to shape them."}
